# Crypto Liquidity Marketplace With ICO (DeFi Project)

Welcome to the Crypto Liquidity Marketplace repository! In this project, weâ€™ll build a decentralized Uniswap ERC20 liquidity marketplace with an integrated ERC20 token sale (Initial Coin Offering or ICO). Users will be able to create liquidity pools for any two tokens and discover liquidity pool addresses across various blockchains.

## Features
Liquidity Pools:
Users can create liquidity pools by pairing any two ERC20 tokens.
Liquidity providers can deposit tokens into these pools to facilitate trading.

Token Sale ICO:
The platform allows token creators to launch ICOs for their crypto tokens.
Investors can participate in ICOs by purchasing tokens using ETH or other supported tokens.

Liquidity Pool Discovery:
Users can explore existing liquidity pools and find their addresses on different blockchains.

# Tech Stack
Next.js: Front-end framework for building React applications.
Uniswap V3: Protocol for decentralized token swaps and liquidity provision.
Hardhat: Ethereum development environment for smart contract deployment and testing.
